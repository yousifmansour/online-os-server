<h2>Refactoring &hellip;</h2>

<p>This online os can be thought of being composed
of two parts. First part is the system, this includes
the Home page and Recent Apps Page. The second part
is the user applications, including everything else.</p>

<p>The project structure should reflect that as much as
possible.</p>

<p>This is how it looks like:</p>

<p>src/actions
src/reducers</p>

<p>src/system
          /components
          /containers</p>

<p>src/applications
          /components
          /containers</p>

<p>Actions and reducers folders setup redux state for 
the whole os.</p>

<p>Components and containers is a pattern used in React.
Components hold files responsible for displaying data
given to them, and they have no state (or very minimal 
state). Containers on the other hand, prepare state 
and other data and pass them down to components to be
displayed.</p>

<p>Containers therefore contain most of the logic, whereas
components contain most of the styling for an 
application.</p>

<p>This structure is nice and increases readability and
predictability.</p>

<h2>Animations</h2>

<p>CSS allows for keyframe animations to be defined. These
are rather simple, but they do add to the overall 
experience. Most of the animations are will be fine
tuned as I see fit.</p>

<p>The setup includes a file called Animations.css which
is available for all system and user applications.</p>

<p>This allows for animations to be reused between 
different applications.</p>

<h2>Hammerjs</h2>

<p>Hammer js is a library that helps implementing touch
gestures. I want to use this so that cards in the 
recent apps page can be swiped away to close the
application. I&#39;m still figuring out how it works.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>1) It would be nice if a preview of the running app can be
shown in the recent apps page like all operating 
systems do. This would require either rendering the 
app in the recent apps page (might be inefficient) or
for a screenshot to be taken for each app when the user
exits so that it can be shown in recent apps (more 
tricky).</p>

<p>2) The back button currently basically uses the history
object of the browser to go back. It should ideally 
undo changes in the current app and eventually close it
instead.</p>

<h2>For next week</h2>

<p>1) I will try to work on the &ldquo;other things&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2) I will work on improving the current apps and fixing
any other problems that might arise with them.</p>
