<h2>Goals for this week:</h2>

<p>This week I was mainly trying to figure out how the interface of the os should work. For phones and tablets, 
something similar to the Android navigation buttons would be good. For PC, it is not needed, but I still
haven&#39;t decided how that will be.</p>

<p>There would be two sections, a viewport for the applications and interface of the OS, and a navbar below it.
Basically exactly like android.</p>

<p>All position styling rely on CSS Flexbox, which handles how items are positioned in a container.</p>

<p>I also added a Diary app to the app list which will contain this documentation.</p>

<p>The scroll position of where the user last left the Diary app is persisted so that one is able to continue
reading.</p>

<p>The Diary app presents a list containing documentation for each week.
It also maintains keeps track of which documentation is open.</p>

<p>I am writing the documentation with ghostwriter which is an app that exports HTML (and also handles images).
The HTML files are then provided by the server for the Diary app.</p>

<p>The server would also provide any files that the OS applications might need in future.</p>

<p>Some apps will require the ability for more than once instance to be running.</p>

<p>The Diary app should allow multiple entries to be open, each with their own state.  </p>

<p>This is what I will be doing next.</p>
