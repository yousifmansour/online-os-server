        <h1>Weeks 0 and 1 (Jan 21 - Feb 01)</h1>

        <p>
            <em>This is a summary of what&#39;s done till now</em>
        </p>

        <h2>The demo</h2>

        <p>During these two weeks, I created a demo of the online os. The demo has a
            simple calculator and note taking apps that maintain their state.</p>

        <p>The state of the os, which includes which apps are open, and the state of the
            open apps, is maintained and communicated to a server, which makes sure that the
            same state exists on any number of connected clients.</p>

        <p>Any state update is sent to all connected clients. It is also saved to a
            database so that it is persisted.</p>

        <p>The front end (client side) of the os uses React,
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/">(a JavaScript library)</a>.</p>

        <p>The state of the applications (including which ones are open) is maintained
            by Redux,
            <a href="https://redux.js.org/">a state container</a>
            that acts as the single source of information for all state in the applicaiton.</p>

        <p>A node service on the back end sets up socket.io,
            <a href="https://socket.io/">enabling real-time communication with the clients</a>.</p>

        <p>MongoDB is used as the database. Node uses Mongoose,
            <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">a mongodb object modelling library</a>
            to interface with it.</p>

        <h2>The way state is maintained</h2>

        <p>The redux state is just a JavaScript object that is defined with a
            <em>reducer function</em>
            that handles updates. The reducer function receives actions that are
            <em>dispatched</em>
            by the app, and updates the state of what&#39;s called
            <em>a store</em>.
        </p>

        <p>Actions have a
            <em>type</em>
            and a
            <em>payload</em>. Redux checks for the type of the action, and updates the
            corresponding part of the state with the payload as defined in the reducer
            function.</p>

        <p>Redux allows for middleware functions to be defined. These intercept actions
            before they are dispatched and processed, and are able to do things before and
            after dispatching the actions.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m using a middleware to send any action that is dispatched by a client
            to the server. The server then
            <em>broadcasts</em>
            the action it receives to other clients that are connected (if any). The other
            clients then dispatch the action they receive from the server (so that it&#39;s
            applied to their local state), which achieves the required behavior of having
            the state changes synced on all clients when its updated on any one of them.</p>

        <p>At the same time, another middleware sends the whole state to be saved by the
            server on the database. This is needed for the state to be persisted when all
            clients disconnect.
        </p>

        <p>This is done asynchronously, although more efficient ways of sending only
            parts of state that have changed would be better.</p>

        <p>When a new client connects, it asks the server for the latest state and
            receives it from the database. Subsequent state updates are received through
            actions broadcast by the server, which is efficient.</p>

        <p>Below is a diagram that shows the flow of state between connected clients and
            the server:</p>
