<p>For this period the goal was to improve the notes and
calculator apps so that they can be a bit more
visually pleasing and have some useful functionality.</p>

<p>Notes app now persists notes in the database (and
therefore can allow multiple notes). They are loaded
into memory (redux state) when the app is loaded.</p>

<p>Calculator is a slightly modified version of the open
source calculator example provided by Andrew Farmer.</p>

<p>Most of the work on these was on thinking what the
simple apps should be able to do, and getting the UI 
elements just right (mostly).</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>During this period other issues presented themselves. </p>

<p>The back button for instance, currently just uses the
browser history to go back to the previous URL. It does
not relate to the current app that is running. This is
not how operating systems should work. </p>

<p>Therefore this is something that needs to be solved 
somehow.</p>

<p>The app that&#39;s running should somehow override the role
of the back button to do what is suitable for it.</p>

<p>The cards that show the recent apps also needed 
improvements. Using react-draggable, it was simple to
make them &ldquo;draggable&rdquo; in the x-axis direction, although
some issues remain to be solved when scrolling as that
interferes with the react component thinking the user
is trying to drag the card in the y-axis.</p>

<p>Animations in react can be controlled in a more precise
manner than simple CSS animations using a module that
it has. I also should find time for researching this.</p>

<p>HTML iframes if implemented correctly (wrapped in react 
components) can make the desktop experience very close
to that of normal desktop environments.</p>

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>The official (scheduled) goals for the coming 2 weeks
are to 1) create a file system backend that is useable
from the frontend and 2) create a file manager that 
supports uploading and downloading files.</p>

<p>I hope to be able to do this in less than the scheduled
2 weeks so that I can work on some of the other things
that weren&#39;t &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The schedule and timing that I have made is also
very conservative and therefore hopefully will allow 
for this.</p>
